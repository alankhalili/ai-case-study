**DeepMind**

**Company Information and Business Activities**

DeepMind's mission is to "solve intelligence" and then use intelligence "to solve everything else." More concretely, DeepMind aims to combine insights from systems neuroscience with new developments in machine learning and computing hardware to unlock increasingly powerful general-purpose learning algorithms that will work towards creating an artificial general intelligence (AGI).  Most notably, the company has made significant advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning and pioneered the field of deep reinforcement learning, which combines these two methods.

**Company Founding and Evolution**

The company was co-founded by Damis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman in London in 2010.  In total, the company raised $50 million in one round. Major venture capital firms Horizons Ventures and Founders Fund invested in the company, as did entrepreneurs Scott Banister, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk. In 2014, DeepMind was acquired by Google for $400 million.

Unlike earlier AIs, such as IBM's Deep Blue or Watson, developed for a pre-defined purpose and only function within that scope, DeepMind's initial algorithms were intended to be general. They used [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), an algorithm that learns from experience using only raw data input. Their initial approach tested the system on video games such as Space Invaders. Without altering the code, the same AI could play certain games more efficiently than any human ever could.

- In 2013, DeepMind published research on an AI system that surpassed human abilities in games such as Pong, Breakout, and Enduro.
- In October 2015, a computer program called AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beatthe European Go champion Fan Hui, five to zero. This was the first time an artificial intelligence defeated a professional Go player. Previously, computers were only known to have played Go at an "amateur" level. Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like chess due to the much larger number of possibilities, making it prohibitively difficult for traditional AI methods such as brute-force
- In 2017, an improved version, AlphaGo Zero, defeated AlphaGo 100 games to 0. AlphaGo Zero's strategies were self-taught. AlphaGo Zero beat its predecessor after just three days with less processing power than AlphaGo; in comparison, the original AlphaGo needed months to learn how to play.

The AlphaGo technology was developed using a deep reinforcement learning approach, which makes It different from other AI technologies on the market. With that said, AlphaGo's 'brain' was introduced to various moves based on historical tournament data. It played against itself and learned not only from its own defeats but also from its wins; thus, it learned to improve itself over time and increased its winning rate as a result.

**Real World Benefit of DeepMind's Approach**

While Google's DeepMind division appears to be a green field R&D effort vs. a specific product development effort, products are coming out of this effort with meaningful impact beyond winning electronic games.

Google has stated that DeepMind algorithms have (i) significantly increased the efficiency of cooling its data centers by 40% by automatically balancing the cost of hardware failures against the cost of cooling, (ii) modeled the behavior of football (soccer) players, including the goalkeeper, defenders, and strikers during different scenarios such as penalty kicks to organize players based on their tendency to behave a certain way during the game when confronted with a decision on how to score or prevent the other team from scoring; (iii) helps researchers restore the empty text of damaged documents, identify the place they originated from, and give them a definite accurate date and; (iv) DeepMind is being trained to identify early signs of various diseases such as diseases leading to blindness, kidney disease, and breast cancer.

One of DeepMind's more impactful applications is weather prediction models such as GraphCast, Nowcast, and MetNet-3.

**DeepMInd and Weather Prediction**

Currently, the gold standard of weather prediction is numerical weather prediction (NWP) models developed by NOAA and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast. Gathering the weather data, running the data through the NWP models, and creating a forecast can take 6 hours. The limiting factor of accuracy is the volume of data needed to compute a prediction within a limited time frame. It's the balancing act between the volume of data calculated, the time required to run the data through the models on a supercomputer, how long weather forecasters can wait for the data, and what level of accuracy is 'good enough'. Currently, forecasters are only willing to wait ~40 minutes. Within those 40 minutes, the models can create a medium-range weather forecast (5-10 days) with 80% accuracy. If NWP models used all the available data, the current accuracy of 80% would surely increase. However, the supercomputer compute time would increase from 40 minutes to 5 hours.

On an apples-to-apples basis, GraphCast, introduced in Q4-2023, can perform the 10-day medium-range weather forecast with 80% accuracy in less than a minute (vs. the 40 minutes using the NWP model). Furthermore, it usually takes government agencies 6 hours to collect, simulate, and tailor the data for local consumption as a weather forecast. Tailoring it for local consumption can take up to four hours.

**Benefits and Commercial Opportunities of Enhanced Weather Prediction**

While Google DeepMind has made the algorithms public, and both NOAA and the Europeans are experimenting with the GraphCast models, Google's plans to commercialize this developing capability are unclear. However, the benefits of more accurate medium-term weather predictions (in both prediction accuracy and granularity) will have significant economic value.

Benefits from enhanced medium-term weather prediction include:

- Agriculture is where citrus farmers can protect orange trees if a freeze is coming.

- Transportation, where maritime shipping companies, airlines, and the U.S. military can navigate disruptive weather systems that put equipment, operational goals, and people at risk.
- Energy is where wind and solar operators can more effectively plan energy availability to meet utility needs and hedge their energy derivatives positions.
- Emergency services, businesses, and individual homeowners can better prepare for weather-related events (avoiding losses) from fire/wind, hurricanes, and rain-related flooding related to river flooding and atmospheric rivers.

**Weather Prediction Market Opportunity**

While the market opportunity for enhanced weather predictions is challenging to predict at this early stage, a subset of the avoidable losses indicates the potential total addressable market is significant in the U.S. alone. According to the Farm Bureau, crop and rangeland losses from major weather events in 2022 totaled over $10.4 billion. While better weather prediction models would not have prevented all of these losses, most of these were tied to wildfires and river flooding, both of which can be significantly improved by providing emergency services, farmers, ranchers, and homeowners with better lead times to minimize the impact of an oncoming event.  Just within this use case, the market is arguably $500 million (5% of the cost savings) in the U.S. alone.

**Adoption of AI Weather Prediction**

While weather has traditionally been considered a free service provided by the government, AI-generated private sector advancements are being noticed by both companies and governments. Insurance companies paid approximately $5 billion of the losses mentioned above and have a track record of paying for enhanced services that can significantly improve their business's profitability. Both airlines and maritime shipping companies will pay a premium to minimize disruptions to operations due to weather. Furthermore, due to the better value proposition to the U.S. taxpayer, the U.S. Government (NOAA and U.S. Airforce) is increasingly looking to the private sector to provide services formerly provided by U.S. agencies via research grants that are designed around an operational use case.

The ability to penetrate these markets/opportunities will largely depend upon (i) the AI models providing reliable predictive models for both typical weather patterns and outlier events that the AI models don't have significant training and (ii) the end-users perceived need to understand how the predictions are being generated. For example, U.S. and European government agencies rely on formulas in the MWP models. Culturally, their inability to look inside the "black box" of the AI model will be a challenge for broad adoption within that community. However, other users, such as governments that can't afford large weather agencies and businesses of all sizes, are more open-minded to adopting a new technology that is reliable despite not being fully understood.

**Recent Weather Prediction Progress**

*Traditional Methods*

The MWP models date back to the 1950s and progress in updating the formulas has been slow due to limited data and compute power. In developed countries with higher quality weather data, the reliability of medium-term weather predictions has increased from ~60% to 80% in the past ten years. While private investors have migrated the MWP models from CPUs to GPUs, with significant improvements in the time to complete the computations, both financial and cultural switching costs appear too high, as this approach has yet to be adopted by government agencies.

*AI Competitive Environment and their Achievements in Weather Prediction*

Competitors in this segment include Huawei, Nvidia (FourCastNet), Atmo, and WindBorne Systems.

As a result of AI, these AI weather prediction companies are quickly catching up, if not surpassing the MWP gold standard.

- February 2022 Nvidia introduces FourCastNet, an AI-generated global data-driven weather forecast model for short to medium-range global predictions.
- In July 2023, Huawei introduced Pangu-Weather, an AI global weather forecasting tool. It was the first prediction model to demonstrate higher precision than traditional NWP models.
- In November 2023, DeepMind introduced its GraphCast model, whose performance exceeded the NWP models.
- January 2024: Using their own constellation of weather balloons, which provides data the competitors do not have, WindBorne Systems (Weathermesh) surpasses DeepMind, Nvidia, and Huawei's AI weather prediction model accuracy with the introduction of their private model that can run on consumer-grade computers.

**Recommendations**

Weather prediction comprises three parts: gathering the data, generating a weather prediction, and presenting the prediction in a format that has been adjusted for local weather characteristics and is easily digestible by the end users, who range from individuals to businesses and government agencies. As stated earlier, this process balances the quality of predictions, the length of time the prediction extends, and the time required to generate a prediction.

Because a government's ability to staff weather experts and fund weather-gathering equipment (ranging from satellites and radar to simple weather sensors found at airports) vary significantly. There appears to be a gap between what predictions are readily available (MWP vs AI), the frequency of updates required, and the level of accuracy required by various users (individuals vs. agriculture vs. energy companies vs. transportation companies vs. emergency services vs. the various branches of the government). These gaps are largely due to government agencies who are underfunded and lack the mandate to address the needs of specific users.

DeepMind should move up and down the value chain to shorten the time required to provide quality weather prediction to the users that need predictions quickly.

- First, develop the ability to use large language models to generate localized weather for a range of end users, significantly reducing the time required to disseminate the information to them. This will reduce prediction turn around time and increase future customer awareness.
- Second, acquire better data than what is coming from the U.S.G, such as space-based radar data from tomorrow.io, to assess the feasibility of launching a fleet of low-cost, long-term weather balloons. This will improve the accuracy of the reports for specific customer use cases.
- Third, develop API to link their system to likely early adopters to accelerate ingestion into their operating systems. Early adopters include: (i) transportation Industry: existing operation management systems in industries such as maritime and airlines, (ii) solar and wind energy provider's operations management systems, and (iii) emergency services: to push emergency weather messages to developing country cellular networks. As customer awareness is improved (during recommendations one and two), this will accelerate adoption of these improved capabilities.
